Hi all ðŸ‘‹

I am a third year PhD student ðŸŽ“ in tropical forest bioeconomics at the University of french Guiana ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡« under the supervision of Sylvain Caurla ([UMR BETA](https://beta-economics.fr/)). I do mostly research at the intersection between economics (ecosystem service evaluation), tropical forest modelling and forestry.
