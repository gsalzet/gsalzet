### Hi all ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Guillaume**, a forest bioeconomist at The French National Forest Office ([ONF](https://www.onf.fr/)) in the R&D department.

I am currently working on a seamless coupling method of biophysical & market models. The goal is to provide expected wood-market trajectories in mainland France and french overseas territories under climate changes scenarios.
